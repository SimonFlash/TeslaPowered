 * Some GUI cases, such as a trade window, would need to allow players to edit
 * certain slots. Is this something feasible for this project, and if so how
 * should we go about determining who can edit a slot?
 *
 * Because this would need to be player specific, we'd likely have to have a
 * Function<Player, Boolean> to return whether the given Player can edit the
 * slot and cancel (or not) the event accordingly.
 *
 * An alternative is to consider having two independent views, and requiring a
 * simultaneous update of each.
